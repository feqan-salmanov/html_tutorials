<P style="color: rgb(233, 141, 20); font-size: 25px;"><em> is the common name of living things classified in the 
    realm of animals (Animalia) in the upper realm of eukaryotes (Eukaryota) of the living world. Although the word "animal"[2], which has been translated into Turkish from the Arabic word ḥayevān meaning "living being", is used to express non-human, breathing and moving creatures in daily use, it also includes humans in the biological context. In Anatolian dialects, words such as bav, bobos, bögü, çer, Çokgal, dölük, evcimen, evlük, karaböcü, karaltı, medek, tereke, töm are used.[3] The synonym of the word animal is the word loop.[4][5][6] The term "Animalia", which is the scientific and Latin name of the animal kingdom, is the plural of the Latin word animal, which is also derived from the Latin anima, meaning "living" or "spirit". Another Greek scientific term describing the animal kingdom is Metazoa.

    It is a multicellular realm that usually adapts to its environment and feeds on other living things. Their bodies develop as the embryo undergoes some metamorphosis. They are eukaryotic multicellular organisms. They generally get their food by digesting it.
    
    Most animals are motile and the thick cell walls typical of plants are often absent.</em><br><em> During embryonic development, cellular migrations and tissue organization occur to a large extent. Their reproduction is primarily sexual; Males and females carrying diploid chromosomes form gametes with haploid chromosomes by meiosis, which in turn combine to form a diploid zygote.
    
    More than 1.5 million animal species have been described, of which about 1 million are insects, but it is estimated that there are more than 7 million animal species with undescribed ones. </em>
